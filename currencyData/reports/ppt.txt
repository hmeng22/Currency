I follow ISO3166 standard, ISO4127 standard and references from web to make a statistics table.

* Country and Currency is ordered by National Wealth 2017.
* Currency denomination are acquired from search results. Some countries are sharing the same currency.
* Currency in Circulation Volume is a national secret and classified. Only US Dollar data is available.

All the data I have now :
* Countries & Currencies : 251
* Currency denomination : 23
* Currency denomination Volume in circulation : 1 (US Dollar)
* Currency Images : 2 (US, Japan)

What is the next ?
1. Since there are so many currencies in the world. National Wealth Order is helpful when we make decisions.
2. The popularity of Currency denomination is very hard to decide. Because countries have different rules.
Rank popularity based on the currency in circulation is also very hard due to the unreachable statistics data.
3. We have to rank Notes popularity individually, or apply the same process to all Notes denomination.
4. Currency Images Marker. How do we define the quality of the Image ?


How to process Note Image ?
1. Collect all the images.
2. Upload images into the storage.
3. Record value:url pair into the table.
4. Process table data into the format we want.
